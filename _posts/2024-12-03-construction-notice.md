# This site is heavily under construction!

### Sit a while and listen! This is a re-vamp of a previous site I wrote many moons ago and had hosted up on InfinityFree. I originally began this project as a way to brush up on React/Next.js and then found out how much it cost to host that. No thank you very much! Not for a hobby website!

I then rewrote it in Ruby on Rails, which was interesting and I have to admit I preferred the whole Ruby ecosystem, except it really is so poisoned by Shopify that it really has become a fairly single use application framework. It was difficult to find decent information on, mostly due to the age, where it's at that mid-life kinda stage. Everyone working with Ruby on Rails was middle-aged, happy to sit and develop, the truest form of "I'm a programmer. I program computers to do things then I go home". React and Next had a much more vibrant ecosphere and had some interesting developments whereas Ruby just felt "solved" - it felt like there was a way of doing things, and that's the way we do it. 
This is absolutely one of the main tenets of the framework, so no complaints there! Just as a learning experience it was a great (possibly better than React) way of learning the whole Model View Controller system.

So what next? Of course I rebuilt the blog into Django. There is something about Django that disconnects the dev from the process that I just didn't find in RoR - it felt like you added some code to a specific area and it worked, but I couldn't visualise what the outcome would be while I was coding it. It's a weird thing to try and communicate without expansive hand gestures and a lot of "you know what I mean?"'s interjected throughout. Maybe more time spent in the Model View Template multiverse would convince me one way or the other, but not something I'm keen on this week. Ask me again next Tuesday?

Damnit Django, why weren't you my saviour! EVERYTHING is Python now (for better or worse) I work in test automation and use Python extensively. This could have been sooooo easy!

But easy is not what I am here for. So let's learn Laravel!
Laravel I found was super cool - I hadn't done any PHP since maybe early 2000s, late 1990s? (Man, I need a new age, something younger would suit me just fine) so it was familiar but I definitely put StackOverflow back on the rotation. I couldn't remember the basics, but once I read them, they Just. Made. Sense.
Why Laravel? Why because InfinityFree hosts those for free! With a little tweaking of the .htaccess file and a painful wait for FTP to upload my folder (I have never been more appreciative of Git) I was up and running!

So now here we are - I've set up the super easy Github Pages, added the Chirpy theme on top, tweaked some basics and now I can write some markdown, drop a few notes, actually just create things that I need to refer back to, or refer people back to. My biggest issue so far is that a lot of what I have written is stuck in a MongoDB table with associated formatting (or lack thereof) so I will slowly read through these and start converting to markdown as necessary. I learn by writing - understanding the skill enough to write it down is a necessary first step to truly locking in that knowledge.

I don't need anyone to know about this site, or even to keep updated. My hope is that some day, somewhere, I'll pop up on some eager learner's search and something I've written down pings that little metaphorical lightbulb above their head. A rising tide lifts all boats, so pay it forward. If you like something on here that inspires that little bulb to flicker, consider adding your own knowledge somewhere on the internet so one day I can search for it.
The internet as we know it today is a hellscape of monopolised corporate greed, so let's just keep quietly adding our own little corner of learning until we inevitably are drawn into the matrix so Amazon can finally own everything. For whatever reason that Amazon has.
