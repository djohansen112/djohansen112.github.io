Ever had that friend, or relative who just seemed to... get it? 

You may have met someone with _**The Knack**_

The Knack is the ability to look at a system or machine and intuitively grasp how that machine works, or could be made to work again. As someone who has trained multiple (!) apprentices over my time in the mechanical trades this is a very real phenomenon.

**Symptoms may include:**
- They jerry-rigged a server in their spare laundry cupboard that serves equal part Tor node, part Plex server?
- They fixed their own lawn mower, which incidentally they found on the side of the road, or picked up off someone who just "couldn't get the damn thing to run".
- They have a raspberry pi. You have no idea why and often they don't either, but they have one and they needed it as soon as they saw it.
- Previous/current Lego nerd is a bonus point!

The group of people with The Knack are seemingly jack-of-all-trades. Give them a tool and a way to access it, and suddenly your system is in their hands and they're ready to let you know that such-and-such is loose, or this bit is deprecated and could do with an update.
These are the kind of people that make or break an organisation - one of the recent trends in software development has definitely been the adoption of coding by the wider mainstream. There's coding camps for kids, boot camps for career-changers and postgrads (even non-grads in some cases) and with the rise of "nerd culture" and the acceptance of living life online there's a real shift in the IT industry. Gone are the days of the life-long software devotee - almost every facet of our modern world brushes shoulders with software, and the necessary understanding of how that software works is increasingly bleeding into job descriptions everywhere.
