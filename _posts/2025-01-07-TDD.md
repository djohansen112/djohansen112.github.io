# TDD Test Driven Development

> This is a quick overview of TDD - something I've been a proponent of for a few years now. I wanted to get a short instructional article up to point some people towards when they ask about it.

In the first step we write a test, this should encapsulate a basic function of the system under test. We'll go into a short demonstration using the FizzBuzz game:

1. Take a number
2. If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
3. If the number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
4. If the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
5. If the number is not divisible by 3 OR 5, then just print the number

> This example is written loosely in C# - enough to keep the structure, but I'm not going to go into depth with the language - consider this as pseudocode. Same with the assertion - we're not here to learn NUnit, or Chai or Behave.

So let's start with our first test on step one in a new class file called FizzBuzzTest:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = Play(1)
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }
}
```
There's some choices we've already made here - we need a method: Play, which takes our guess as the parameter. 

As software developers we understand the basics of what we're building intuitively. Trust that intuition and just begin, the TDD process will take care of the rest. This is a concept of Confident Competence - "it'll be fine, trust me, I'm an expert". You have to Trust The Process!
Let's start with some trust in the process and create the code to pass this test:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = Play(1);
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }

    public bool Play(int guess){
        return true;
    }   
}

```
In one step we've already forged ahead. We have a class with a method. This is now a functional program. Sure, it does nothing and it fails the test - but that's what we're after. This is called Red condition.

Wait, we can fix this! It looks like we needed a string to be returned, so let's fix that up:
```cs
 public string Play(int guess){
        return guess.toString();
 }   
 ```
So now we have a passing test. Now it correctly retuns a string: "1" - so we've had a failing test (Red), now we've got a passing test (Green), so now we can compelte the third step - Refactor!
Let's move that test and the actual program out to separate files and refactor so we can call from one file to another:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(1);
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }
}
```
```cs
public class FizzBuzzGame {

    public string Play(int guess){
        return guess.toString();
    }    
}
```
Woohoo! We've solved it. Now let's check that specification. Welp, that's disappointing! We really only satisfy one rule so far.

Let's add a second test to that FizzBuzzTest class:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(1);
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }

    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy3_ThenPrintFizz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(3);
        Assert.That(result == "Fizz");
    }
}
```
If we run that second test, then it fails - Perfect! We can add some logic to our Play method so it passes:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzGame {

    public string Play(int guess){

        if (guess % 3 == 0)
            return "Fizz";
        return guess.toString();
    }    
}
```
Red. Green. Refactor - but do we need to refactor? Most likely not in this case - the tests are passing, and everything seems like it all makes sense, so let's move on.
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(1);
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }

    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy3_ThenPrintFizz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(3);
        Assert.That(result == "Fizz");
    }
    
    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy5_ThenPrintBuzz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(5);
        Assert.That(result == "Buzz");
    }
}
```
Another Red, so let's get to Green:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzGame {

    public string Play(int guess){

        if (guess % 3 == 0)
            return "Fizz";
        
        if (guess % 5 == 0)
            return "Fizz";
        
        return guess.toString();
    }    
}
```
So now we can refactor - this is the start of where refactoring will make sense now that we can see some repeated code, maybe thinking through this triggers a thought about pulling the check into a "isDivisibleBy" method which takes the guess as a parameter. Maybe you want to further push this into a switch statement. Maybe you just look ahead at how far through the specs you've gotten and decide this is far enough!

There is a wide spread criticism of TDD - you need to know what you're testing to create that initial test! Don't worry if you've already had this thought, you are correct! What we need to understand is that TDD is not complete without Refactor. This is not the last time we'll write this code, in fact, we NEED to rewrite this code to be correct. Once we have a passing test, we can refactor it into whatever complexity or pattern seems most appropriate.

For now, let's just finish off the project:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzTest{

    @Test
    public void NumberIsNotDivisibleBy3Or5_ThenPrintNumber(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(1);
        Assert.That(result == "1");
    }

    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy3_ThenPrintFizz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(3);
        Assert.That(result == "Fizz");
    }
    
    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy5_ThenPrintBuzz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(5);
        Assert.That(result == "Buzz");
    }
     
    @Test
    public void NumberIsDivisibleBy3And5_ThenPrintFizzBuzz(){
        string result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(15);
        Assert.That(result == "FizzBuzz");
    }
}
```
Back at Red, so let's get to Green:
```cs
public class FizzBuzzGame {

    public string Play(int guess){

        if (guess % 3 == 0 && guess % 5 == 0)
            return "FizzBuzz";
        
        if (guess % 3 == 0)
            return "Fizz";
        
        if (guess % 5 == 0)
            return "Fizz";
        
        return guess.toString();
    }    
}
```
We're done. Now what is the next test? Here's some suggestions with suggested solutions:
- User can enter a number from the keyboard - add an input functional loop
- User is given an error message if the input is blank - add input validation
- User is given an error message if the input is not an integer - add error messaging and checking
- User is given another guess until they choose to quit - add a loop to the program
- User can quit the program - add loop break points


What about refactors:
- Move the check step into "isDivisibleBy(int guess)" method
- Use a switch/case statement as the conditional
- throw errors as required with correct error handling
- instead of checking divisible by 3 && 5, check it is divisible by the lowest common factor 15 instead to clean it up.

Even though this is a hugely simplified example, there are some great features of TDD that will accelerate development AND reduce testing. 
There are simple, instant benefits of every single line of code being related to a test:
- high code coverage
- testable code
- instant regression
- developer endorphin rush from that Green condition!

Never underestimate the benefit of writing code that instantly sets off regression alarms. Rather than wait until DevOps taps you on the shoulder when next they deploy your package, you can see that the code you added 5 minutes ago causes a problem, and deal with it while it's fresh. If you're anything like me, you are not risking forgetting what you just did by getting stuck into another problem and not remembering where you were up to - if you didn't get a Green, then work til you do, or if it's still Red, revert back to Green until you can devote the time.
