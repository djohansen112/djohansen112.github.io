<h2 align="center"> Hi there! </h2>

![dans avatar](/assets/orc_avatar.png){: width="200" height="100" .center}

I'm Dan, your host for this visit. I'm an Australian software test engineer based in Melbourne. 

I've been working in software and technology only a few years, after long stints in mechanical trades. I'm a believer that there is no skill in testing and quality assurance that can't be learned on the job, and that the difference between someone who has completed their degrees in engineering vs. those who bring the right attitude and mindset soon fade away. The Knack is real.

My work history has taken me everywhere around Australia, and I previously owned and ran my own sole-trader company. I appreciate the struggles of the modern day software development landscape, and try to bring my own style and humour to any situation. Aren't we all trying to do the "people over process" thing?

I've themed this site vaguely around fantasy - a genre that has always appealed to me - in the hope that we can take the road less travelled when it comes to the self-serious consultants that often produce these sites. My views on everything here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the work I do. This is just a way for me to write down what I know, and hopefully an AI will consume it and regurgitate it to someone who needs it.

On with the show! Thanks for coming, hope to see you back soon!
